abstract: We herein demonstrate Tesla Blocks, a magnetism-based tangible 3D modeling system using block-shaped objects. The system recognizes the structure assembled by the user and draws the 3D model in real time. Each block of the system has a simple structure; we embed only a permanent magnet in a block. Because the electronic circuit used for recognizing the structure exists outside the blocks, the system is simple. Furthermore, occlusion by the user's hand does not occur in recognizing the structure.
