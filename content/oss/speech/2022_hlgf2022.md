abstract: "In the World Economic Forum 2019, Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) was advocated. Especially for some domains such as medical institutions and governments, where privacy protection is essential, it must handle sensitive data such as healthcare data and personal information. Distributed ledger technologies such as Hyperledger Fabric make it possible to share data among multiple organizations with trust. However, it is not suitable for sensitive data because the distributed ledger discloses stored data to all organizations. Hyperledger Fabric has implemented features such as Channel and Private Data Collection to handle sensitive data. In addition, Hyperledger Fabric Private Chaincode allows transactions and data to be executed in a confidential manner by running chaincode on a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) which is a CPU security feature. However, it requires a special machine with TEE. At the beginning of this presentation, Koshi will introduce OSS distributed ledger technologies, starting with Hyperledger Fabric Private Chaincode. Next, Koshi will introduce one of their use cases and show how to run Fabric Private Chaincode on Microsoft Azure.
