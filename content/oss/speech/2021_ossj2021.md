abstract: "In the World Economic Forum 2019, Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) was advocated. Especially for some domains such as medical institutions and governments, where privacy protection is essential, it must handle sensitive data such as healthcare data and personal information. A distributed ledger technology makes it possible to share data among multiple organizations with trust. However, it is not suitable for sensitive data because the distributed ledger discloses stored data to all organizations. In this research, we solve the problem with an approach to store the sensitive data on external storage in a specific organization for each data to avoid sharing the data with all organizations."
